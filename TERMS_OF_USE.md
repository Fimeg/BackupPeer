### Data Sovereignty Rights
- **You own your data** - encrypted and controlled by you alone

- **No obligation** to accept any storage request

### 2. **Trust & Reputation System**
- Participate honestly in verification challenges

### üõ°Ô∏è **RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES**
- **Only use peers with HIGH trust scores** (0.8+ recommended)
- **Verify peer reputation** through community feedback
